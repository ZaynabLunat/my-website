# My personal websiteâ€”a place where I will share more about myself.

## This website is being built using React and Next.js frameworks to put into practice the skills I've learned over the past two weeks. The primary focus is to create a seamless user experience while highlighting my love for UX/UI design. It will also showcase my passion for UX/UI design, and showcase projects I will have completed, am working on, or have conceptualized.
